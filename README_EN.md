[YetAnotherRibbonSystem](https://github.com/AXiX-official/YetAnotherRibbonSystem) is a new combat feedback system that redesigns the presentation of Ribbons and adds a Devil May Cry like real-time scoring system for entertainment purposes.

## Installation

Download the latest `YetAnotherRibbonSystem.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/AXiX-official/YetAnotherRibbonSystem/releases) page and extract it to get the `res_mods` folder.

Navigate to the game's installation directory and place the `res_mods` folder into it to get a path like `World of Warships\bin\xxxxxxxxx\res_mods`, where `xxxxxxxxx` is the highest numbered folder out of all the folders in the `World of Warships\bin\` directory.

If prompted to overwrite a file, feel free to do so.

## Customization

### Ribbons

All Ribbon icons are in the `YetAnotherRibbonSystem/Ribbons` folder and can be replaced at will.

### Rating Level

The default levels from low to high are `N`, `R`, `SR`, `SSR`, `PRY`, `UR`, `DR` (from the rarity levels of shipgirls in Azur Lane). You can find them in the `YetAnotherRibbonSystem/Level` folder and replace them with images of the same name.

> [!NOTE]\
> The scoring system is for entertainment purposes only and has no practical significance. It is not related to the actual game score.\
> If you have any suggestions for the scoring system, you can submit an Issue to let me know.
